## Module 01: Introduction to Amazon Web Services
**Definition of Cloud Computing** - Cloud model comprises five essential chrematistics, three services, and four deployment models.

**Essential Chrematistics** 
* Broad Network Access
* Rapid Elasticity
* Measured Service (For pay-as-you-go basis)
* On-Demand Self-Service
* Resource Pooling

**Service Models**
* Software as a Service (SaaS)
* Platform as a Service (PaaS)
* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

**Deployment Models** 
* Public
* Private
* Hybrid
* Community
<br/><br/>

**AWS Global Infrastructure** - 
* AWS Region - separate geographic area
* AWS Availability Zone - Availability Zone as data center. A availability zone may have multiple data center but because the are close together, they counted as 1 Availability Zone.
<br/><br/>

**AWS Identity Access Management (IAM)** -
* Access Management
* User Group
    * One user can assigned multiple group
    * Sub-group not allow
* Users
    * Create User
    * Change Password: Security Credentials -> Update Console Password
    * Set MFA (Multi-factory Authenticator)
* Roles
    * Use to communicate each other between different services or same service with different regions
* Policies
    * Policies can be set per User or User Group
    * Direct Managed: A huge pre-defined policies available
    * Customer Managed: Can create custom policy
* Dentity Providers
* Account Setting
    * Change Password Policy
<br/><br/>

## Module 02: AWS Compute
**AWS EC2 - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** - is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. In other words virtual machine in the AWS Cloud environment. It reduces the time required to obtain and start the new server in a minute.
